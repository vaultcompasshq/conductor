# FINDINGS

This is a durable, append-by-PR record of what conductor actually did when
run against real changes: this repo's own dogfood runs, other Vault &
Compass repos, or public downstream projects that install the umbrella. A
gate result that only lives in a terminal scroll or a closed pull request
evaporates; this file is the place it lands instead, so false-positive and
false-negative classes accumulate across runs instead of being rediscovered
by the next person who hits them.

A run that found nothing still gets a row. "It caught nothing" is itself a
datum: it is the only way to tell whether the umbrella (or one of the three
gates it runs) is blind on that input or the base rate of real issues in it
is genuinely low. Log the clean run, not just the interesting one.

## Format

One row per run. Append new rows at the bottom, in chronological order. Do
not edit or delete existing rows; if a verdict turns out to be wrong on
later review, append a new row that corrects it and say which row it
corrects.

Verdict is one of: true positive, false positive, true negative, false
negative, could-not-run.

| Date | What was scanned (repo/artifact + version) | What the gate said | Verdict | Follow-up |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-01-01 (EXAMPLE) | example-app (git SHA abc1234) + conductor 0.4.0, conductor run | conductor: clean, nothing blocked. 2 gate(s) ran. | true negative | none |
| 2026-09-18 | A pull request with an empty diff, gated through conductor's intent stage with intent-guard-version pinned to 1.5.1 | intent-guard refused the umbrella's --paths "" (the empty change set conductor sends for an empty diff) as a missing value and printed usage text instead of a report; conductor read that as a failed gate | could-not-run | Fixed in conductor 0.4.3: the intent-guard-version default moved from 1.4.0 to 1.5.2, which accepts an explicit empty list. Never pin intent-guard-version to 1.5.1 here. See CHANGELOG.md, [0.4.3] - 2026-09-18. |
| 2026-09-20 | A first pull request from a consumer team running the umbrella in advisory (non-required) mode, conductor 0.4.4, before "conductor init" had ever landed on their base branch | Exited 2 (a thrown PolicyError: No .guardrails.yaml on the base ref) but printed the reason only to stderr; stdout, the text report the pr-comment step reads from, was empty | could-not-run | Fixed in conductor 0.4.5: the absent-base-config case now goes through the same could-not-run reporting path as an unresolvable trust-base ref, with the reason in the text report, a verdict: exit 2 line, and the head's gates named as DID NOT RUN. See CHANGELOG.md, [0.4.5] - 2026-09-20. |
| 2026-09-20 | A second consumer team's first pull request, same pre-fix conductor version and same missing base-branch policy file, also in advisory mode | Same exit 2 with an empty stdout report; the team read the red, unexplained step as the action being broken rather than as an unfinished adoption step, and opened a support question before finding the stderr line | could-not-run | Same fix as the row above. Also exposed a second, unrelated gap: on a shallow (fetch-depth 1) checkout the action did NOT fetch the base ref at all, so origin/<ref> was unresolvable and conductor got a trust-base miss on --trust-base. This PR adds a base-ref fetch, and it must use an explicit ref:refs/remotes/origin/ref refspec, because a bare "git fetch origin <ref>" only updates FETCH_HEAD and never creates the origin/<ref> tracking ref on a single-branch checkout. |

## How to add an entry

Open a pull request that appends one row to the table above. Any seat may
open it, human or agent. Keep the table chronological. A clean run (true
negative) and a run the gate could not complete (could-not-run) are both
worth recording, not just the runs that found something.
