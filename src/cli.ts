 * exactly like a run from the top.
 *
 * This used to catch everything and return the working directory. Two quite
 * different failures hid in that: git is not on PATH, and this directory is
 * not inside a repository. Both then produced "no .guardrails.yaml here, run
 * conductor init" from a subdirectory of a repository that has one, which is
 * a confident answer to a question nobody asked. The generated hook has
 * always named a missing git in its own words (src/init.ts), for the same
 * reason.
 *
 * Errors rather than a fallback root, because the alternative is silently
 * gating a commit against the wrong tree. `run`'s own catch turns these into
 * one line on stderr with no stack and the could-not-run exit code, so
 * nothing here has to know about either.
