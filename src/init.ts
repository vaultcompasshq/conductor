// `conductor init`: one policy file, one pre-commit hook, one manifest.
//
// The manifest is what makes --revert honest. Without one, "undo the init"
// means guessing which files were the tool's, and a tool that guesses about
// deletion in somebody's repository has to be wrong only once.
//
// Four properties are the whole point, and three of them are bugs some tool
// in this family has actually shipped:
//
//  1. FAIL CLOSED. A missing umbrella binary blocks the commit. The
//     tempting alternative, warning and letting the commit through so a
//     teammate without the tool is not stuck, means the gate is silently
//     absent exactly where it is most likely to be absent, and a guardrail
//     that is off when the tool is missing is a guardrail an attacker turns
//     off by making the tool missing.
//
//  2. PRESERVE THE EXIT CODE. 2 means a gate could not run; 1 means a gate
//     blocked. A hook written the natural way, `if conductor run; then exit
//     0; fi; exit 1`, collapses 2 into 1 and reports findings that were
//     never looked for.
//
//  3. A RELATIVE core.hooksPath RESOLVES AGAINST THE WORKTREE ROOT, not
//     against the .git directory. A sibling tool resolved it against the
//     .git directory and the test that covered the case asserted the same
//     wrong location, so the two agreed with each other and neither was
//     checked against git. The test here drives a real commit instead.
//
//  4. NEVER STACK A SECOND HOOK. If a gate already installed its own
//     pre-commit hook, adding the umbrella's alongside it means that gate
//     runs twice and its findings appear twice. Init reports the collision
//     and stops, or replaces the gate's hook when told to adopt it.
//
//  5. NEVER WRITE INTO A HOOK MANAGER'S GENERATED DIRECTORY. Where git
//     looks and where the hook a human maintains lives are not always the
//     same file. husky 9 sets core.hooksPath to .husky/_, a generated and
//     gitignored directory it rewrites on every install; the file git
//     executes there is a dispatcher that execs the TRACKED hook one
//     directory up. Reading the dispatcher reports the repository's real
//     gate hook as foreign, so --adopt cannot adopt it, and writing the
//     dispatcher puts the umbrella hook somewhere the next install deletes
//     without a word. Found by running this tool against a real husky 9
//     repository, which is the only way it could have been found: every
//     fixture in the suite agreed with the code.
//
//     The recognition rule is structural and nothing else: the hooks
//     directory is named `_` and its parent is named `.husky`. Only husky
//     creates that path. See huskyDirectoryFor for why neither the content
//     of the executed file nor the presence of husky's shim is allowed to
//     join the rule: the first fires against husky 8's tracked hook and
//     points init at the repository root, and the second fails exactly
//     after a `git clean -xdf` has removed the gitignored generated
//     directory, which is the state this whole property exists to survive.
//
//  6. A MANAGER WHOSE HOOK TEXT LIVES IN package.json IS REFUSED, AND THE
//     DECLARATION IS THE SIGNAL. simple-git-hooks and yorkie generate
//     .git/hooks/pre-commit from a key in package.json and rewrite it on
//     every install, and neither has a tracked file to write instead. What
//     makes them different from lefthook is that the declaration is there
//     BEFORE the manager has ever run: a fresh clone has no generated hook
//     to read, and that is exactly the state somebody runs init in. So the
//     package.json key is checked as well as the file, and either one alone
//     is enough. Found by running this tool against two of the eight public
//     repositories in a dogfood run: both would have taken the umbrella hook
//     and lost it at the next install, with the manifest still recording it
//     as installed. See detectManagedHook and declaredManagedHooks.

 *
 *  2. THE MANIFEST OUTLIVES A PARTIAL REVERT. It is deleted only once it
 *     holds nothing, because it is the only record of what is left AND, after
 *     an --adopt, the only copy of the gate hook that was replaced. Deleting
 *     it while that content was still needed made the gate's own hook

 *     code is non-zero and a script does not read "some of it" as "all of it".
 *
 * `--force` removes a changed file anyway, restoring adopted content if
